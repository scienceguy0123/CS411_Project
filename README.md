Idea #1: Marketplace for Goods
The web application is a marketplace for goods available for sale (posted by users of the web application), such as clothes, shoes, furniture, etc. 
The user creates an account with an email and password. Once they choose a category they can see a list of available items for sale with information on the item and seller. 
The user is also able to post any items that they would like to sell and can track all them on one page. A user can link to their Twitter and/or Facebook. Once an item is posted, a tweet is sent out (API #1) and the item is placed on Facebook Marketplace (API #2).

Idea #2: Flight Price Tracker
The web application is a flight price tracker, which notifies the user when the price of a flight falls below a certain threshold. 
The user is able to input preferences, such as the travel dates, origins and destinations, number of stops, and loyalty programs. 
An account storing user profile information will be needed, so a database will be created. Additionally, the web application will feed on two public APIs, namely ITA Matrix and Frequent Flyer Programs (FFPS) Listings. 
It will also use third-party authentication, probably through Gmail or other social media.

Idea #3: Marketplace for Textbooks
The web application is a marketplace for BU-specific textbooks, which allows BU students to find the best prices for their coursesâ€™ textbooks. 
The application will use third-party authentication of the BU Gmail. Additionally, the user will be able to input preferences, such as the courses they are taking, whether to buy or rent, textbook conditions (fair, good, new, etc.). 
The application will feed on two public APIs, which are the Amazon Bookstore and BU Barnes and Nobles for price comparison purposes as well as course textbook requirements.
