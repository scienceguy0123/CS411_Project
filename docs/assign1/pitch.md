Idea #1: Marketplace for Textbooks
The web application is a marketplace for BU-specific textbooks, which
allows BU students to find the best prices for their coursesâ€™ textbooks.
The application will use third-party authentication of the BU Gmail.
Additionally, the user will be able to input preferences, such as the courses
they are taking, whether to buy or rent, textbook conditions (fair, good,
new, etc.).
The application will feed on two public APIs, which are the Amazon
Bookstore and BU Barnes and Nobles for price comparison purposes as
well as course textbook requirements.

Idea #2: Flight Price Tracker
The web application is a flight price tracker, which notifies the user when
the price of a flight falls below a certain threshold.
The user is able to input preferences, such as the travel dates, origins and
destinations, number of stops, and loyalty programs. A
n account storing user profile information will be needed, so a database
will be created. Additionally, the web application will feed on two public
APIs, namely ITA Matrix and Frequent Flyer Programs (FFPS) Listings.
It will also use third-party authentication, probably through Gmail or other
social media.
